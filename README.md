# Project Overview
In this project, I used the OpenWeatherMapAPI and my problem solving skills to create a representative model of weather across various cities. 
•	In WeatherPy I’ve created a script to retrieve weather data from certain cities and created a series of scatter plots to showcase the relationships between Latitude vs. Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness and Wind Speed. In addition to this I’ve computed linear regressions for each of the following relationships: 
•	Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
•	Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
•	Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
•	Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
•	Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
•	Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
•	Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
•	Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

In VacationPy, I used my weather data skills plus the Geoapify API to help plan future vacations. 

## Analysis of Findings 
You may find the results in each document - "RP.VacationPy" and "RP.WeatherPy".

### Instructions to Final Work 
The final Jupyter notebooks are in the "starter_code" folder. The notebooks are named "RP.VacationPy" and "RP.WeatherPy". 
I used the AI Virtual Assistant to assist in writing and debugging the code. I did not work with anyone else on the assignment. 

Thank you!
